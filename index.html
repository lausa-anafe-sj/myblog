                    <h2>About Cordova</h2> <br>
                    <p>CORDOVA
                        Cordova (also spelled Cordoba) is a municipality located in the 6th district of Cebu Province in the Philippines. Most of Cordova lies on separate islands off the southern coast of Mactan Island. It is connected to the main island of Mactan over three bridges.
                         The total population of Cordova is 50,353 (2010 census). Its territorial area comprises some 740.86 hectares (1,830.7 acres) and 48.75 hectares (120.5 acres) on the islets of Gilutongan, Nalusuan, Shell, Tongo and Lava.Geographically, Cordova is situated on an island, together with Mactan Island, almost in the middle of Cebu Strait, and is separated from Cebu Island by Cebu Channel. The two islets of Gilutongan and Nalusuan belong geographically to the Olango Island Group.
                          The surface of the town consists entirely of Karst limestone rock geologically associated with the so-called Carcar Formation, and is dated to thePliocene-Pleistocene boundary (approx. 3-2 million years ago).
                          The topography of Cordova is listed as flat land, the highest point being 10 metres (33 ft) above sea level. Cordova has six hotels and resorts, while some tourist areas include:
               Gilutongan Marine Sanctuary
               Nalusuan Marine Sanctuary
               Day-as Boardwalk and Marine Park
               Kamampay Public Beach
                         A special attraction is the mangrove forest and swamp area. The best access to this area is the Day-as Boardwalk and Marine Park. The total mangrove plantation is estimated to cover more or less one hundred hectares. Most of the mangrove forest is located in the barangays of Pilipog, Bangbang, San Miguel, Day-as and Catarmán. </p>

                            <p>Adjacent to Lantaw Floating Restaurant at the end of Cordova Tourism Center lies the 10,000 Roses Cafe. Miguel Cho is the owner and an interior designer. The renowned Dongdaenum Design Plaza in South Korea served as his inspiration. His goal in building the cafe was to create a romantic atmosphere ideal for a couple's first date—a location that would be fitting for the start of a happily ever after.</p> <br>

                            <p>The Moorish-inspired architecture of the San Roque Parish in the town of Cordova, which features two imposing columns on either side of the front, makes it stand out. The town center is where the church is situated.

                                However, prior to the construction of the building you see today, the town's citizens erected a flimsy building composed of stones, wood harigues or tabique pampango, and a nipa palm roof, according to church records. It was constructed by Fr. The first parish priest was Jose Salazar. The Cordoba Parish was given to the Cebu District on May 22, 1863, and was renamed San Roque Parish of Cordoba, announcing Sr. San Roque is the honorary patron.

                            <p>A little distance from the Cordova shoreline lies the white sandbar known as Bantayan Bay, which is home to mangroves. On a bright, sunny day, its stunning turquoise waters shimmer like glass. With its wide open expanse far from the shore and a white sand substrate beneath the waist-deep water, it unmistakably looks like a summer holiday spot.
                                Mangroves are found growing at the sandbar's edge, where the sandy land abruptly ends in a deep blue ocean abyss. Every tourist is treated to breathtaking views of Cordova's immaculate white sand beaches while strolling around the bay's waters; these are genuinely gifts from nature.</p> <br>

                            <p>Due to its white sand beaches and marine sanctuary, which offers snorkeling and undersea diving to visitors, the island is a popular stop on island-hopping trips. Local government on the island is handled by Barangay Gilutongan. The barangay's boundaries also includes the nearby uninhabited island of Nalusuan. Gilutongan Integrated School is the only public school in Gilutongan. Typhoon Rai, also known as Supertyphoon Odette, destroyed most of the residences in Gilutongan in December 2021 and damaged 85% of the residents' boats. Relief aid was given to the impacted households on the island by the Philippine Navy, civil society organizations, and the local government.</p> <br>

                            <p>Since the area is home to many reef eels due to the sea's tidal flats being primarily grassy and muddy, which is conducive to the eels' nourishment, Entoy's Bakasihan is likely the oldest and most well-known restaurant offering bakasi in town. So, if you're prepared to try something unique with your loved ones, make a stopover here and relish the legendary Bakasi while taking in the refreshing sea breeze.</p> <br>

                            <p>June 2022 saw the reopening of Lantaw Cordova on a new floating platform close to the restaurant's entrance. Even though it is much smaller, it still has a tranquil, picturesque ambiance that is ideal for dining outside. 

                                In order to allow natural airflow, the restaurant keeps its walls open. For social events, parties, and dinner dates, the ambience provides a cozy mood. 
                                
                                It is large, but not too big, so you can still roam around and take shots of the wide ocean. Admire the stunning vista of the Mactan Channel, the 10,000 Roses Cafe in the vicinity, and the recently inaugurated Cebu Cordova Link Expressway (CCLEX).</p> <br>
